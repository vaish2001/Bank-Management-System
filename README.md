# Bank-Management-System
The primary aim of this “Bank Account Management System” is to provide an improved design  methodology, which envisages the future expansion, and modification, which is necessary for a  core sector like banking. This necessitates the design to be expandable and modifiable and so a  modular approach is used in developing the application software.
